# Overview

The Brigade Project Index is a collaborative effort involving core contributors from across many brigades.

We design, develop, and maintain a set of tools and practices for mapping out all the work being done on projects across the entire global network of civic hacking organizations and Code for America brigades.

Our core goal is to publish a rich and constantly-updated database of projects that any number of network projects can use as a data source to help us get better connected.

This tool collects data about civic tech projects crawling Github or other projects repositories (as provided by civic tech organizations)

## How to Get Involved

- Tag your projects on github!
  - Make sure your brigade's projects are listed in the index ([instructions](contributing/get-indexed.md))
  - Using the github "Topics", tag your project directly in github with #code-for-america and your brigade tag (e.g. code-for-sf). Then include any relevant topic tags from [this list](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-taxonomy/tree/master/issues-addressed).

- [Search for Projects](https://projects.brigade.network/)

- Join the discussion!
  - We primarily use slack (https://cfa.slack.com #brigade-project-index), and meet every 2 weeks, usually Sunday at 6pm. Drop a note in the slack channel to be included.
