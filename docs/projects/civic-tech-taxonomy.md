This project aims at a categorization of civic tech projects. There have been numerous attempts at this important goals, various websites that provide lists of civic tech projects have implemented their own classification.
A comprehensive and intuitive projects categorization is critical in order to avoid duplication of efforts, improve volunteer recruiting and retention, optimize resources, seek for repeatable processes, reach the market and more.

There are some significant challenges to achieve such a good taxonomy

- Open source civic tech projects spring up often without strong organization
- How projects are defined / tagged
- Abstract classification of the issues to tackle, the beneficiary of the project and more
- There are mainly 2 approaches on leveraging projects tags
  - Projects are manually input in a database with specific tags
  - Crawlers or queries retrieve all tags of all projects of interest
- In the first case, the list of projects is limited and projects details risk to be outdated. In the second case, the tags can’t easily fit in a define taxonomy, there are many variations of the same keyword, there are tags that refer to realms (like technologies or locations).
