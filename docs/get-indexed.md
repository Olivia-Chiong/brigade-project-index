# List Your Project

This page explains how you can get your project listed in the Index projects that we support.

## Cross Brigade Project Index

The index automatically pulls data from the [brigade-information project](https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade-information):

1.  View the [organizations.json file](https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade-information/blob/master/organizations.json) and look for your brigade (a simple cmd-F should do the trick).
2. If your brigade is already listed, check the following fields:
    1. **“projects_list_url”** should be your brigade’s GitHub URL.
    2. **“tags”** should include "Brigade" and "Code for America".
3. If your brigade is _not_ listed there or you want to consider other ways to include your brigade’s projects, choose one of the other methods.

Note that currently, non-US and non-brigade organizations aren’t currently pulled into the Project Index Statusboard.

## Tagging your brigade’s projects

The group that has been working on this project has begun to form a taxonomy.  When assigning topics, please check [the existing topics](https://statusboard.brigade.cloud/#/topics) (and consider adding to [the official set](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-taxonomy/tree/master/issues-addressed) if something is missing) first to be sure you’re not creating a duplicate.  **For COVID-19 related projects, please use the topic “covid-19”.**
