description = "In just the last few years, Capital One, TJX Companies, Sears, The Home Deport, and Equifax have all been hacked, exposing credit records to bad actors. New credit cards, loans, or other lending accounts could be opened with that information, unless you freeze your credit. Freezing your credit is one of the best ways you can protect yourself from identity theft and fraud. No company currently provides a way for Americans to freeze & unfreeze their credit across all three major credit bureaus at once. This is what Snow-capped provides."
